# Multi-Market Algorithmic Trading Strategies

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains two complete algorithmic trading systems developed and tested across six global markets (forex and crypto). The goal was to create a risk-managed framework capable of generating consistent monthly returns while keeping drawdown tightly controlled.

### âœ… Strategy 1: Momentum (Candle-based)
- Triggered by price action momentum (e.g., consecutive bullish/bearish candles)
- SL/TP dynamically scaled based on candle structure
- Tested on BTCUSD, ETHUSD, and EURUSD

### âœ… Strategy 2: Hilega Milega (Indicator-based)
- Based on crossover signals using Hilega Milega indicator + RSI filters
- Trailing stop logic built into the system
- Tested on AUDUSD, AUDCAD, and USDJPY

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary
- **Avg Monthly Return**: ~4.16%
- **Max Drawdown**: â‰¤10%
- **Markets Tested**: BTCUSD, ETHUSD, EURUSD, AUDCAD, AUDUSD, USDJPY
- **Prop Firm Challenge**: Successfully passed (13% profit in under 3 months)

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Multi-market execution with normalized `x` scaling logic
- SL/TP optimization through variable-based segmentation
- Drawdown computation from every possible start-date
- Strategy-layered portfolio allocation
- Real-world backtests, not just theoretical models

## ðŸ“¢ Notes
- The project was built iteratively over a year, combining manual backtesting, code-based simulations, and live trading validation.
- Code is not beginner-friendly by design â€” itâ€™s real-world quant logic, not a tutorial.
- All strategy logic and supporting files are publicly shared for credibility and transparency.
